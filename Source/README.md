# Clear The Grid code

You probably won't need any of the code, but... for the sake of completeness and transparency.

Here you will find the code used to generate to different levels. You can use it to generate other grids with the same level, but it's very very unlikely that you can generate the same levels again :-)

The Generator project is used for the leve generation.
The Shared project is , well, a shared code base of the maps, solutions, and other constructs we used.
The Checker project might actual be usefull, because it can verify your solution file against a level file.
