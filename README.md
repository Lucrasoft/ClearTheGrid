# ClearTheGrid

Welcome to the *ClearTheGrid* Code Competion repo.

## Game

The idea and rules of the game can be found [here](GAME.md)

## Goal :goal_net: 

The real goal is to reach the highest level at the end of the competition. 
There are 499 levels. You win a 'level' by providing a solution for that level.

Your highest level counts if you have provided the solution for all the previous levels as well. 
 
## Offline
This is an *offline* code competition meaning that your code doesn't have to solve the levels realtime or all at once. Just solve every level at your own time and pace. You may calculate or tweak as long as you wish. You can throw all your threads, multi processors, schemes and logic, CPU's and GPU's or whatever at the problem. Also any programming language, etc. As long as you provide a solution (even by hand!) for a level. 

## Expectation
Although the first levels are doable, even by hand, the levels get trickier and harder to solve. Don't feel upset if you have a hard time reaching anything beyond level 50 or 100 or...It just get's really hard very fast. 

## Competition

Besides the Best Score competition, you can also go for 
- The Creative Solution 
     - Use your imagination and create the most stunning visual presentation of the game.
- The Nerdiest Solution 
     - Do something nerdy or awesome with the idea of this competition. For example: Use a obscure development language. Or go nuts with Lego, Rasperry Pi's, .. 

## Team Up!

Ofcourse it's okay to team up. Share your idea's and approaches in your team, but we discourage to share actual code.

## Submission

On the end of the competition you can :

Deliver us your solution files. We will verify them and re-determine your highest achieved level. Keep in mind that you must provide all levels from bottom to you highest level. You cannot skip a level :smile:
